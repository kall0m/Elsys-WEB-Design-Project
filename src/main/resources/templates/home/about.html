                        Hi there! My name is Kaloyan. Welcome to my blog for design, tasty food and healthy lifestyle.
                        I am from Bulgaria and I am an ICT student at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.
                        I have a strong interest in software development and user experience.
                        I am passionate about drawing, cooking and healthy lifestyle.
                        I feel intoxicated by possibilities.

                        I love to live a healthy life. I eat 90% sugar-free, I don't drink, I don't smoke.
                        I try to do sports at least twice a week. I have a diet infused with superfoods and
                        vegetables. I try to avoid meat which I eat once or twice a week.
