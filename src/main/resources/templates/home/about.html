                    <p>Hi, my name is Kaloyan. Welcome to my blog for fitness exercises, tasty food and healthy
                        lifestyle.
                        I am a student in eleventh grade in TUES, Sofia, Bulgaria. I love fitness, especially crossfit,
                        cooking and living a healthy life.</p>

                        <br />
                        I usually work out 2 to 3 times a week, eat healthy and tasty food (I rarely eat junk food and
                        drink carbonated drinks)
                        and get 6 to 8 ours of sleep although I have much homework.
